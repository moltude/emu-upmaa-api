emu-upmaa-api
=============

my own layer for interacting with imu api.


Although the imu api is great I found it really annoying to have to do all that configuration and authentication 
every single time I needed to run a query. Also, when I did run into problems with the api I didn't want to have to 
add all of the debugging and logging intformation into all of the code snippets I used. So I wrote this to handle 
the authentication and some of the the query management.
